    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "You are likely aware of the idea that the Earth has north and south magnetic poles. However, these names are a bit misleading. For one thing, since Earth's \"magnetic north pole\" attracts the north end of a magnet, we would actually call it a *south* pole in physics. Further, these poles don't exactly coincide with the geological poles, and in fact the north pole is wandering NNW at about 55km per year. To confuse matters even more, by taking note of how flows of ferromagnetic magma have solidified in the past, we know that the Earth's fields undergo occasional **geomagnetic reversal** events, in which the magnetic poles effectively swap places.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from all these complications, the magnetic field of the Earth is stable enough for us to use it for navigation. In a compass, a magnetized needle on a low-friction bearing will swivel to align itself with the local magnetic field. This tells us what *direction* the horizontal component of the local field is pointing in, but what of the *magnitude*? Where you stand, how strong is the Earth's magnetic field?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this pre-lab, you will use simple vector analysis to see how it's possible to measure the local magnetic field using only a compass, a coil of wire, and a DC power source. This will equip you with the analytic tools to carry out the actual experiment in this week's lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, the power source and the coil form a simple electromagnet called a **solenoid**. In accordance with Ampère's law, the steady current produces a magnetic field. Due to the geometry of the solenoid, the internal field points along the axis of the coil (Fig. 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the magnetic field at an arbitrary position near an arbitrary solenoid, while not impossible, is very difficult to do and the expression obtained is quite ugly. However, if we're interested in the field at the midpoint of the solenoid's axis, the calculation can be greatly simplified by assuming that the solenoid is *infinitely long*. It can be shown that this approximation holds when the radius of the solenoid is much less than its length. \n",
    "\n",
    "One obtains the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\vec{B} = \\mu_0 n I\n",
    "\\label{eq:Bmag} \\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $I$ is the electrical current in the coil, $n$ is the **turn density**, or the number of turns per unit length, and $ \\mu_0 = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7} $ H/m is a constant, called the **vacuum permeability**. \n",
