    "Among the primary goals of physics (and in science in general) is the construction of a coherent picture of how the world works. In this pursuit, we wish to *build*, *test*, and *revise* models and theories. While *all* models are necessarily only approximations of reality, these approximations (and thereby our understanding of the world) *can* be improved. This effort is multi-generational, multidisciplinary, and fundamentally collaborative. \n",
    "\n",
    "One vital aspect of this work is to seek out and investigate cases where our models fail, but we must be *certain* that what we're seeing isn't skewed by imprecise measurements or other experimental flaws. This is one of the many reasons we may wish to increase the precision of our experiments. (Note that deciding whether an experimental result is significant is, in practice, a more subtle matter than simply calculating $\\sigma$ - for those who are interested in learning more, [this](https://news.mit.edu/2012/explained-sigma-0209) brief article from MIT discusses some of the complications).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lab, you witnessed some of the factors that affect the quality of the data collected. Specifically, you should have seen that the **standard deviation** depends on the *quality* of the measurements, but not the *quantity*, while the **standard error in the mean** is sensitive to both. This week, you will continue to experiment with the simple pendulum (Fig. 1). Using the procedure you developed at the end of Lab 1 (and perhaps refining it further) you will gather high-precision data in order to test the limits of the simple model of the pendulum.\n",
