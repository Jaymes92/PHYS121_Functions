Error propagation is the method by which we translate the uncertainties in our measurements to the uncertainties in quantities derived from those measurements. Put mathematically, if $X$ and $Y$ are measured quantities with uncertainties $\\delta X$ and $\\delta Y$ respectively, what is the uncertainty $\\delta Z$ associated with some derived quantity $Z = Z(X,Y)$?. This can get quite complicated, but if we're not concerned with getting the tightest bound possible (i.e. we're okay with calculating the *maximimum* possible error), there are some simple rules we can use:\n",
