    "When a quantity, such as the period of a pendulum, is measured many times using the same measurement technique, one obtains a **distribution** of measurements.  Most of the time (but not always), the data follow a **Gaussian** distribution which is also known as a **normal** distribution or **bell curve**.   \n",
    "\n",
    "A **histogram** is a plot of the frequency with which a measurement falls with a specific range of values called a **bin**.  For example, a bin with boundaries $x_1$ and $x_2$ would capture measurements with values of $x$ between $x_1$ and $x_2$: $x_1\\le x < x_2$.  If a sufficient number of data points are collected, a histogram of the measurements will approximate the shape of a Gaussian distribution.  Bins with a large number of counts occur near the peak of the distribution and bins with a small number counts appear near the tails of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows an ideal Gaussian distribution.  It has been normalized so that the total area beneath the curve is one. To produce this ideal distribution, one would need to make an infinite number of measurements of the quantity of interest and then plot a histogram of those data.  Of course, this is impractical so we can only hope to use a finite set of data to approximate an ideal distribution.  The peak of the distribution occurs at mean value $\\mu$ and the width is characterized by the standard deviation $\\sigma$.  The horizonal axis in Fig. 1 shows the locations of $\\mu$, $\\mu\\pm\\sigma$, $\\mu\\pm 2\\sigma$, and $\\mu\\pm 3\\sigma$.\n",

    "The area beneath a normalized Gaussian distribution between to points $x_1$ and $x_2$ along the $x$-axis gives the probability that a single measurement $x$ will fall between those values.  For example, in Fig. 1 region shaded dark blue extends from $x_1=\\mu-\\sigma$ to $x_2=\\mu+\\sigma$ and has an area of $0.68$.  This observation implies that $68\\%$ of measurements are expected to fall within one standard deviation $\\sigma$ of the mean $\\mu$.  In a similar way, $95\\%$ of measurements are expected to fall within $\\pm 2\\sigma$ of the mean and $99.7\\%$ of measurements are expected to fall within $\\pm 3\\sigma$ of the mean.\n",
