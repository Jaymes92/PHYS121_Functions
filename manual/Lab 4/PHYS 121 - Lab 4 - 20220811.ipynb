    "## Introduction:\n",
    "It is often the case in physics that the techniques developed to solve one type of problem can be applied to other problems in a different field of physics.  For example, the methods developed to analyze simple electric circuits can be applied to numerous other types of problems.  Here are three examples:\n",
    "* Heat transfer in a complex system, such as a low-temperature physics experiment, can be analyzed in terms of a thermal circuit. \n",
    "* Mechanical resonators, such as a mass on a spring, can be analyzed as an $LRC$ circuit.\n",
    "* Fluid flow in a system of pipes and pumps (or the circulatory system of the body) can be modeled and analyzed using circuit concepts.\n",

    "Imagine the simplest possible single-loop electric circuit made using a battery, resistor, and ideal or zero-resistance connecting wires (left-hand side of Fig. 1).  The voltage difference $\\Delta V$ of the battery drives the flow of charge $q$ around the loop.  The current at any point in the circuit is given by $I=dq/dt$, which represents the amount of charge $dq$ crossing a surface in time $dt$.  The resistance $R$ is related to the voltage difference and current via $R=\\Delta V/I$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, imagine an analogous hydraulic or water circuit (right-hand side of Fig. 1).  Instead of a flow of charge, there is a flow of a quantity or volume $v$ of water.  To avoid confusion with voltage, we will use lowercase $v$ as our symbol for volume.  The analogue of current is, therefore, the volume flow rate $Q = dv/dt$.  It is conventional to use capital $Q$ as the symbol for volume flow rate and we will need to take care not to confuse it with charge which we will represent with a lowercase $q$.  It is pressure differences $\\Delta P$ that drive the flow of water in hydraulic circuits.  A pump is one way to establish a constant pressure difference in a hydraulic circuit.  Wide pipes serve as our ideal connecting wires and narrow tubes act as hydraulic resistors.  By analogy with electrical resistance, we can define a hydraulic resistance as $R_\\mathrm{H}=\\Delta P/Q$.\n",
