    "\n",
    "If we were only interested in how $h$ varies as a function to $x$ for a fixed value of $y$ (say $y=0$, for example), we could construct an ordinary plot of $h(x, 0)$ versus $x$ and the vertical axis would simply represent the height above the ground.  Figure 2 shows such a plot.  \n",

    "If we want to simultaneously show how the height varies with both the $x$ and $y$ positions, we need another way to show the values of $h$ when the horizontal and vertical axes are used to represent the $x$ and $y$ positions, respectively.  In Fig. 1, this is achieved by drawing lines or *contours* of constant $h$.  The topographic map of Fig. 1 is also called a 'contour plot'.  Notice that every second contour line in the figure is labeled with its height above sea level (the units are meters).  To make the plot easy to interpret, the difference in height between adjacent contour lines is always the same value. In Fig. 1, the difference in height is $2\\rm\\ m$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the orange arrow in Fig. 1.  It is parallel to a section of the $26\\rm\\ m$ contour.  If you were in the quarry and walking along the orange arrow, your elevation would remain constant.  It's like walking along a ridge in a mountain range, for example.  On the other hand, if you were walking parallel to the blue arrow, you would be climbing the mountain.  For the blue arrow, adjacent contours are closely spaced such that your height would be increasing rapidly (the mountain is steep near the blue arrow).  Finally, walking in the direction of the red arrow would cause you to lose height.  Because adjacent contours are spaced further apart, the descent is more gradual compared to the ascent of the blue arrow. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another convenient way to encode the height data is to use a colour scale.  For example, the colour blue can be used to represent low altitudes and red to represent high altitudes.  Figure 3 is another representation of the topographic map shown in Fig. 1 above.  These plots are sometimes referred to as 'false colour' plots and are quite common in physics and other science disciplines.\n",
