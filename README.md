# PHYS121_Functions
- last updated August 4, 2022

Note that the Jupyter Notebook included in this repository (PHYS_121_Functions_demonstration.ipynb) makes use of a module called 'data_entry' (accessed via PHYS121.py) which was written by Dr. Carl Michal from UBC.  The original source code for the module (data_entry.py) can be found here: https://phas.ubc.ca/~michal/data_entry.py.

Python functions written for use in the PHYS 121 lab at UBC Okanagan.

To use the functions described below, place the PHYS121.py file in the same directory as your main Python code.  Then import PHYS121 using:
```python
import PHYS121
```

The following functions are currently aavailable:
* Generate scatter plots
* Weighted and unweighted linear fits
* Weighted and unweighted power law fits
* Weighted and unweighted $RC$-charging fits
* Weighted and unweighted fits for the Eddy-current braking lab
* Plot a histogram and generate basic statistics
* Overlay multiple histograms
* Overlap multiple histograms
* Generate multiple scatter plots on a single graph
* Import and display an image with a figure caption
* Data entry using a spreadsheet-like environment
* Import data obtained from a Tracker video analysis
* Play a YouTube video within a Jupyter notebook

Example implementations of the various fuunctions are shown in the Jupyter notebook file 'PHYS_121_Functions_demonstration.ipynb' provided in this repository.
